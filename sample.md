- list 1
    * 1.  I know that a breadth-first-search-tree of an undirected graph can't have a back edge. But I'm wondering how can it even have a cross-edge? I'm not able to image a spanning tree of a graph G constructed out of OFS, that contains a cross-edge.
    * 2. I had this same question...and the answer is that there are no cross edges in the BFS, but that the BFS tree itself encodes all the edges that would have been back-edges and forward-edges in the DFS tree as tree edges in the BFS tree, such that the remaining edges which the undirected graph has, but which are still not present in the BFS, are cross edges--and nothing else.
